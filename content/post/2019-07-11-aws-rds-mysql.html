summary: "Amazon RDS is another amazing service provided by AWS (Amazon Web Services) that is designed to set up, manage, and scale a relational database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and more in the cloud. Not only that, but Amazon RDS assumes the day-to-day management tasks associated with MySQL such as backups, failure detections, recovery, and scaling. I decided to make the switch onto Amazon RDS using the free tier so I could make my database easily accessible for my shiny app. In this post, I will provide two ways for you to make this necessary switch and why you should."

<p>If you had a chance to read my post <a href="https://jagg19.github.io/2019/05/mysql-r/">Using MySQL with R</a>, you’ll see that I like to use MySQL to store larger datasets for open-source projects. I found myself with access issues when trying to use MySQL as the database for a shiny app that I was looking to deploy. After googling around a bit, the best solution was to utilize Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) to properly provide access to the database on my shiny app.</p>
<p>Amazon RDS is another amazing service provided by AWS (Amazon Web Services) that is designed to set up, manage, and scale a relational database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and more in the cloud. Not only that, but Amazon RDS assumes the day-to-day management tasks associated with MySQL such as backups, failure detections, recovery, and scaling. I decided to make the switch onto Amazon RDS using the free tier so I could make my database easily accessible for my shiny app. In this post, I will provide two ways for you to make this necessary switch and why you should.</p>
<p>At the minimum, you will need an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a> account to create an RDS. When you create an RDS, you are provided with an endpoint URL which we will use as the host when connecting through SSH or on MySQL Workbench. See below on how to create an RDS after you log in to AWS.</p>

<div id="launching-a-aws-rds-instance-to-run-mysql" class="section level1">
<h1>Launching a AWS RDS Instance to run MySQL</h1>
<p>To start, select the services tab, RDS under database, and then click create database. There are plenty of configuration settings, but leave them to default unless stated below.</p>
<div id="step-1" class="section level5">
<h5>Step 1</h5>
<p>Select the DB Engine. We will select MySQL and make sure to check the box that says “Only enable options eligible for RDS free Usage Tier.” Click Next.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/RDS-MYSQL/rds_step1.png" />

</div>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="step-2" class="section level5">
<h5>Step 2</h5>
<p>Select the DB engine version. I’m selecting MySQL 8.0.15 since I have the same engine on my local desktop. Since we selected the Free Tier, our only DB Instance Class option is the “db.t2.micro - 1vCPU, 1GiB RAM” and our Allocated storage will be set to 20GiB.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/RDS-MYSQL/rds_step2.png" />

</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Scroll down the page to Settings and add your DB identifier, master username, and master password. Set and remember your password since you will be prompted for it multiple times. Click Next.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/RDS-MYSQL/rds_step2b.png" />

</div>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="step-3" class="section level5">
<h5>Step 3</h5>
<p>Make sure your public accessibility is set to “Yes” or else our instance will not have a public IP address assigned. Also, please make sure “Create new VPC security group” is selected so we can allow access to read the data to anyone. If you are storing sensitive data then you will need to configure the security group settings or subnet groups which is beyond this scope. I am only looking for easy ways to access non-sensitive data seamlessly at any location.</p>
<p>Under Database options, just enter a database called “testing” so we can ensure everything was loaded correctly once we connect to our DB Instance. Leave the rest of the settings to default unless you’d like to snoop a little more. For these purposes, we do not need to change any settings so click create database. It will take ~10 minutes to launch the database and back it up so be patient :)</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="step-4" class="section level5">
<h5>Step 4</h5>
<p>Wait for our RDS to finish launching. Under the Summary tab for our new RDS, you will see it turn to “Available” (Please keep note of where your endpoint is located as we will later need it).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/RDS-MYSQL/rds_endpoint_location.png" />

</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>After, scroll down to Security group rules. Under “Type” you will see one rule for Inbound and one for Outbound. Click the Inbound security group link and it will navigate you to the “Security Group” tab.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/RDS-MYSQL/rds_security_pre.png" />

</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Click the “Inbound” security group checkbox and then click the inbound tab on the lower screen. Hit “Edit” and open the dropdown under Source to change it to “Anywhere” and click save. See below:</p>

</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once you go back to your RDS instance, you should see the changes made under “Security group rules”. Its now time to connect to your new MySQL RDS Instance!</p>

<div id="connecting-through-terminal-and-mysql-workbench" class="section level1">
<h1>Connecting Through Terminal and MySQL Workbench</h1>
<p>I’m going to show two ways to connect to our new AWS RDS Instance. If you have no interest in using the terminal to connect, then you can <a href="#workbench">click here</a> to learn how to connect your Instance to MySQL Workbench.</p>
<div id="terminal" class="section level4">
<h4>Terminal</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>You must already have a version mysql installed into your computer before you can call mysql. Please see <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/8.0/en/">MySQL Installation</a> and choose the instructions for the appropiate operating system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Copy and paste your Endpoint which you will find under “Connectivity and security”. To connect through your local terminal, enter the below command with your appropriate values.</p>
<p><code>mysql -h &lt;Endpoint&gt; -u &lt;Master Username&gt; -p</code></p>
<p>Then it will prompt you for a password which is the master password you created with your username. Once you entered everything correctly, you will be logged into your MySQL DB that is hosted on Amazon RDS. Let’s see if the “testing” database was loading correctly during the initial set up.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/RDS-MYSQL/rds_term_login.png" />

</div>
<p>We can see our testing database so we’ve configured Mysql correctly! Now we are up and running through the local terminal. Let’s see how we can do this through MySQL Workbench.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><a id="workbench"></a></p>
</div>
<div id="mysql-workbench" class="section level4">
<h4>MySQL Workbench</h4>
<p>Launch MySQL Workbench and click <code>+</code> next to MySQL Connections. You will then be prompted to enter some details about the host, user, password, port, etc.</p>
<p>Give your connection a name. I named mine RDS MySQL. Enter your RDS Instance Endpoint as the Hostname. Add “3306” to the port, and your master username and master password under Username and Password. Store your password so you do not need to enter it each time. Click OK once you’re done and then click your new connection.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/RDS-MYSQL/rds_create_cnt_wrkbnc.png" />

</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>If successful, you will be logged in and should see our “testing” database.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/RDS-MYSQL/rds_create_cntpst.png" />

</div>
<p>Everything looks great! Now let’s add some data. If you want to put your current local database onto the new RDS, it is very using the MySQL Workbench interface.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="importing-local-mysql-to-your-new-remote-mysql" class="section level1">
<h1>Importing Local MySQL to your new Remote MySQL</h1>
<p>Log into your local root user MySQL DB and navigate to the Administration tab and click Data Export. Select the database you want to export and select “Export to Self-contained File” then click Start Export.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/RDS-MYSQL/rds_start_export.png" />

</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Log into your remote AWS RDS Instance and navigate to the Administration tab and click Data Import/Restore. Check “Import from Self-Contained file” and navigate to the file to add the path. Then, we will select the database we want to import it to which in our example will be the testing database. Now we can hit Start Import and after a minute or two we can see all of the data was imported successfully.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/RDS-MYSQL/rds_start_import.png" />

</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let’s run a simple sql command to see the last 10 rows of one of the tables that were imported.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/RDS-MYSQL/rds_check_import.png" />

</div>
<p>After importing the data, we can see 9 new tables in our testing database. Now we can access the data using the endpoint as the host on any device. This also means I can easily integrate this database to my public applications such as any Shiny Apps.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>We went over how to create an RDS using Amazon Web Services and how to deploy a MySQL Database to the cloud. Creating a MySQL RDS can make all of the data easily accessible. With just a minor security setting, the database can be reached via the internet through the shiny app. Amazon RDS uses a feature called Multi-AZ which provides an up-time of at least 99.95% and contains “standby” replica’s of your database in another “zone” to ensure a database is always up and running. Creating backups and scaling your database to easily handle user traffic could not be any easier using RDS.</p>
<p>Next, I will go over different options for creating EC2 instances that can run R, RStudio, and MySQL using our free-tier (Rstudio provides EC2 instances but require “Paid” instance types). This is great for many reasons, but just like Amazon RDS, two of the greatest benefits is scalability and accessibility. For now, go ahead and use this article to start switching your small project DBs to the cloud using AWS!</p>
