summary: "While most of us have used or considered booking an Airbnb, there are a lot less of us who have considered posting our own property on Airbnb. Being that New York City rent is extremely high, I’ve considered listing my Brooklyn apartment to see what kind of profits I could turn. During this time, I was learning about multiple linear regression in my Quantitative Analysis & Forecasting class and was assigned a project to create a linear model to predict some form of dependent variable. I figured why not use this opportunity to dig a little deeper on estimating a listing price for my apartment."

<h1>Using Airbnb</h1>
<p>By now, most Gen Z and millenials have heard of or used Airbnb for a range of many reasons, such as looking for a place to crash or taking a vacation. I believe what won the consumer’s attention over hotels was the fact that you are getting the “homey” setting and privacy while away on vacation instead of a hotel environment. I realize not everyone wants to part ways with room service, benefits of a having full-service bar in the lobby, pool &amp; spas, sometimes a gym, and the 100+ channels, but when comparing the prices and the extra sq. footage, it is hard not to take a look at and possibly book Airbnb listings.</p>

<h1>Listing on Airbnb</h1>
<p>While most of us have used or considered booking an Airbnb, there are a lot less of us who have considered posting our own property on Airbnb. Being that New York City rent is extremely high, I’ve considered listing my Brooklyn apartment to see what kind of profits I could turn. During this time, I was learning about multiple linear regression in my Quantitative Analysis &amp; Forecasting class and was assigned a project to create a linear model to predict some form of dependent variable. I figured why not use this opportunity to dig a little deeper on estimating a listing price for my apartment. This led me to stumble upon pretty interesting information about commercial operators listings on Airbnb in New York City. To keep this post in line with the subject, I will just quickly summarize what I found in the following paragraph.</p>
</div>
<div id="commercial-operators" class="section level1">
<h1>Commercial Operators</h1>
<p>What exactly is a commercial operator? This is an Airbnb host that has multiple entire-home listings or controls many private-room listings. If I was to post on Airbnb to try and squeeze a profit, I would list my property for certain days or weeks of the month, and at most a rental property if I happened to own one. This compares to commercial operators who may have 4-6 entire home listings and 8-12 private room listings. It was estimated that commercial operators make up 12% of NYC Airbnb hosts, but earned almost 1/3 of all incoming revenue.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-is-this-an-issue" class="section level1">
<h1>Why is this an issue?</h1>
<p>I believe it is an issue because it is depleting the actual prices hosts could get for their properties if they were to list on Airbnb. If it weren’t for commercial operators saturating the market with these lower-priced listings, maybe I could squeeze an extra $20-30/ night from my listing. Think of these NYC commercial operators as the Walmart or Amazon of property listings. They often charge less per night than other hosts do across all listings and adjust their rates to attract a high number of rentals overall. To summarize, they are flooding the New York City markets with lower-priced listings.</p>
</div>
<div id="now-the-fun-stuff---building-the-model" class="section level1">
<h1>Now the fun stuff - Building the Model</h1>
<p>I found my data off of InsideAirBnb.com which is an independent, non-commercial set of tools and data that allows you to explore how Airbnb is really being used in cities around the world. I retrieved all listings in NYC as of 03/2018. This was a very large data set that contained 29,142 listings in NYC with 96 different factors to choose from as my independent variables. I would like to keep in mind the effect commercial operators have on prices. I believe that Airbnb listing prices are not fully predictable by the usual variables one would use to predict the price of a traditional property in NYC. These usual variables are factors such as bedroom count, bathroom, location, property type, and etc. If the listing prices were fully explainable by these usual variables, then I would assume with our data we will be able to train and build our model strong enough to have a low root mean squared error (RMSE). See below for how I got to our final Model.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-process" class="section level1">
<h1>The Process</h1>
<p>After loading in the data, I began to analyze the structure to search for any outliers or missing values. Our initial data set has a dimension of 29142 rows and 96 columns so let’s begin cutting down the amount of factors playing into the pricing. I will choose the variables that make the most sense when predicting a price for a property.</p>

<p>Please note that this is quite a bit wider than the confidence interval, indicating that the variation about the mean is fairly large. This means the datapoints of price are very spread out from the mean, indicating there is possibly more to the listing price than the variables used.

<h5>The RMSE here is still high in my opinion after training the model with 13,600 observations. I would not seek a RMSE of 67.4365899 to efficiently price my property, and this is mostly because our model is getting trained to price property’s a bit low due to those commercial operators saturing the market with low price listings. I noticed that when the # of reviews increase, the price for the listing slightly decreases. This can either mean the model is not correct for this type of data, or that since commercial operators generally price very low they tend to have a lot of transactions which results in more reviews than the average lister.</h5>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>These commercial operators are bringing down the prices of Airbnb listings and true home sharers cannot compete. In fact, 10% of these hosts (about 5,000) earned 48% of NYC’s total Airbnb revenue totaling $318 Million while the bottom 80% (over 40400) earned $209 Million in 2017. I believe once the playing field is leveled between consumer hosts and commercial hosts, the variance between individual fitted values and the population mean will start to decrease and the listing prices can be predicted with less noise.</p>
