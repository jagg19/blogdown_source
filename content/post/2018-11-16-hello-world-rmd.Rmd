**Does it work?** Seems like it does. This is my first blog post! I wanted to create my own blog using R programming, R Studio, Git, and Github where I would host my personal site and opinions. These opinions will not be fabricated and will be based off my personal analysis. 

**Why start a blog?**
I have a huge passion for analyzing financial data, especially those 10-K's and 10-Q's!! I do not get excited from fleshing out models on excel all day, but I do get excited from the picture painted using all the tools these filings provide. To most, a 10-k is just a 75+ page document full of financial jargon and data. To me, I see a bunch of puzzle pieces that each individual / analyst can put together in their own unique way. I find the difference in the outcomes extremely fascinating since each analyst is seeing and hearing the same information as the other (I know some analysts go a step further by doing their own channel checks through other sources, etc.). Where they start to diverge from the other analysts is what they do next with that information. I've been running my own analysis on different public companies that interest me, and I would like to publish my opinions so I can receive feedback and meet others with similar passions. There is so much information and data in the world of finance, so much that I know it is impossible to learn all of it. My goal is to find which parts of this information are important and beneficial to my career and my personal life.
