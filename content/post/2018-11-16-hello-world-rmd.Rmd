**Does it work?** Seems like it does. This is my first blog post! I wanted to create my own blog using R programming, R Studio, Git, and Github where I would host my personal site and opinions. These opinions will not be fabricated and will be based off analysis. 

**Why start a blog?**
I have a huge passion for analyzing financial data, especially those 10-K's and 10-Q's!! To most, it is just a 75+ page document full of financial jargon and data. To me, I see the companies vital's, the heart, the engine, the fuel gauge to whether or not any profit potential is left in the companies valuation. I have been running my own analysis on a couple different public comapnies that I have been following, and I would like to publish my opinions so I can receive feedback and meet others with similiar passions.
